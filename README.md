  Blog
</h1>

The source code for the blog is built using Gatsby and is based on [the excellent template](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog) created by [@lekoarts](https://github.com/LekoArts).

## Deployment

1. Merge the commits/PR to `main` branch.
2. From the `main` run `npm run deploy`. This will start a github action.
3. The site should automatically be published in a few minutes. 


## Debugging
Make sure that `gh-pages` is chosen as the deployment branch in github settings and the right custom domain is added.
