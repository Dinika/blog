Hey, I'm Dinika!

I am a software engineer experienced in architecturing and developing web applications. 
I am currently working for the Blue Brain Project at EPFL where I am developing applications that help neuroscientists manage huge amounts of data to get closer to our goal of digitally reconstructing and simulating the brain.
